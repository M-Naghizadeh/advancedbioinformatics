Bioconductor project
--------------------

The goal of the Bioconductor project is to advance statistical analysis and understanding of existing and upcoming high-throughput biological
experiments. Bioconductor is based on packages written primarily in the
R programming language. Bioconductor is committed to open source,
collaborative, distributed software development literate and
reproducible research. Enabling user and developer communities is an
essential part of our mission. Scientific, Technical and Community
Advisory Boards provide project oversight.
